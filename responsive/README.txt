1. As far as I can recognize, all aspects of the code are correct from a functionality perspective. However I am unsure whether or not comments were necessary and did not any.

2. I did not work with anyone spare the TA Phil, who helped me with github. 

3. I spent roughly two hours working on this assignment.
