Assignment 2
README.md

1. I believe I have correctly implemented all of my work. I did not comment at all throughout as the code itself is fairly basic and could easily be understood. I likely could have found better png icons for the user and passenger.
2. I went to see Manish and spoke briefly with Thomas Chang-Davidson.
3. I spent 8-10 hours on the project.
