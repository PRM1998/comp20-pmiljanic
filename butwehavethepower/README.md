Lab 5

1. I believe I have implemented all the aspects of this assignment 
correctly. I added the provided lyrics in intervals while being sung 
on video. Additionally I added a style.css file that centered the
video, title, and lyrics. I did not comment throughout, however I 
did not find it necessary as the coding was fairly simple. 

2. I collaborated with no one.

3. I spent approximately 2.5 hours in total on this assignment.
