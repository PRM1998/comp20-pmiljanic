1. The purpose of this github repository was to keep track of the work I had completed throughout the course of this class. Additionally, and more importantly, it acted to back up all the work I completed throughout the course and allowed collaborators (in this case Ming) to see my code and troubleshoot problems I faced.

2. My favorite assignment was assignment 3. I really enjoyed working with the mongodb and heroku, despite the fact they were new to me. The best part of the assignment was that I truly felt confident working through it and in the end I was proud of my code.

3. In terms of confidence, I feel as though I have grown tremendously. I no longer feel as lost as I have before when facing problems and now believe that I can find the solutions to issues I face with relative ease.

4. That you really can find nearly everything you might need on the web. The mozilla documentation has been incredibly helpful and the documentation associated with heroku and mongodb was integral to me finishing assignment 3.

5. I really want to try working with databases more. As a Chemical Engineer, I feel that more exposure to databases would make me more hireable.
