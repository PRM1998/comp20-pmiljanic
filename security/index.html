  <h1>Introduction:</h1>
  	<p>This is a report of the security flaws and vulnerabilities associated with the "liftknockoff" app (a private car service) made by Gabrielle Beaulieu. I was hired to locate such flaws and notify the appropriate parties of their existence and parameters. Pending contract, I believe that I may in fact be the one to correct these security flaws.</p>

  <h1>Methodology:</h1>
  	<p>To begin, I attempted to broach the user data from the app. Following this, I inspected the code itself for obvious flaws. Upon investigation, I thought it imperative to immediately notify the Beaulieu team of my findings.</p>

  <h1>Abstract of Findings:</h1>
	<p>
		This report sought to identify security issues used by the app "liftknockoff", and found several ranging in severity from cost to loss of privacy. It was found that user data could be retreived (including their locations upon request of a ride), that user data could be broached/shared easily from within the team, and ultimately that the site could readily be the victim of a "spam" attack in which the site could be lead to crash. 
	</p>

  <h1>Issues Found:</h1>
  	<h2>
		<h3>Could Retrieve User Data:</h3>
			<p>
				With the use of the app's get route associated with "/passenger.json" it was found that one could retrieve all the user data by inserting a query string that utilized the mongodb operator $ne (not equal). This get route returns the passenger data associated with a given username (pulled from a query string). The url used in the browser was: https://obscure-lowlands-79425.herokuapp.com/passenger.json?username[$ne]=123. This flaw functions as it returns user data for all usernames whose username is not "123". Several usernames (aside from 123) were tested to ensure that all user data was being retrieved. This issue is fairly severe as malicious hackers could use the location data to track users and observe from where and to they go. This could lead to physical harm of the users or drivers in the wrong hands. To address this, between lines 96 and 97 one could insert code such as: 
			</p><img src="code1.JPG"></p>

			<p> The above code checks to see if the program is responding with multiple users data, or only one. This would require the adjustment of the existent conditionals to ensure that only one response would be sent. Also note that this is sample and simple code, and there could be significantly more succinct manners to correct this.

		<h3>The password and username to the databases created are readily available:</h3>
			<p>The password and username for the databases created was readliy available to be found in the source code, a bad coding practice. On line 15 of the index.js file one can find that the password for the databases generated by mongodb is "RzmiHJBrx.cj!R4", and the username: "heroku_gw4p44k1". Accessing this can give one of malicious intent free access to the database as line 15 provides both the username and password for the mongodb database. While this is not easily accessed by an external party, it is readily accessed by internal parties which can still be quite dangerous based on their character. This problem is somewhat dangerous, as hopefully members of this team are trustworthy, however as once again this individual would not only gain all data concerning users this is noteworthy. To prevent this issue from developing, the portion of the conditional using the explicit MongoURI could be removed all together, and the password and username distributed only on a need-to-know basis. Below are two photos, one showing the existent code (Photo 1) and another showing a line of precisely the same function, but not explicitly providing the sensitive information (Photo 2).

		<h3>The API Key for Google maps is readily available:</h3>
			<p>
				The API key specific to this team's Google maps API is readily available to the public, a glaring flaw. Upon simple inspection of the page using developer tools, the key (AIzaSyDRY8bX6rT6spQ8gtjP4W9ikMDIEUpCQjQ) can be found in the script tag on line 133 of index.html. The discovery of this API key by those of malintent could be used to launch a denial of service attack or alternantively could be used to spam the API to run up the bandwidth used (and in turn the costs of running the app). To correct this, Google suggests securing the API key by storing the key in a file outside of the source tree. Additionally, Google allows for the option to add restrictions to the API key, such as to limit certain IP addresses and block known hackers, or using HTTP referers to ensure only the correct pages call the API key. Furthermore, Google allows you to monitor the bandwidth used and one could observe an ongoing "spam" attack. Below is a photo showing the flaw.

  <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
  	<p>While these flaws are each significant, additional flaws most certainly exist and upon further investigation could be uncovered, however it was decided to notify the team of these issues immediately. Without the protection of user data, this app will most certainly lose traction amongst users, and should the flaws be exposed the company will likely need to be shut down. While this may be harsh, it is important as an app designer to keep user interests at heart. Thank you for reading.</p>
